#  Polish Yahtzee
This is a variation of Yahtzee played by my girlfriend's grandparents. Since we wanted to play it and buying deuce was such bother, I programmed a desktop game in JavaFX.
Enjoy!

Top entertainment for the whole family:
  - 1-4 players
  - includes AMAZING (and crude) music player
  - addicting gameplay

#   Rules:
In terms of figures possible to roll, there are few additional categories comparing it to classic Yahtzee:

-Small Full - Three-of-a-Kind + Pair, but the Three-of-a-Kind must consist of Aces, Twos or Threes

-Dog - Every dice must have different value (e.g. 1,2,3,4,6; 1,3,4,5,6 etc. Small Straight and Big Straight are different categories)

-Odds - All 5 deuce have odd values

-Evens - All 5 deuce have even values.

There are 3 rounds:

  - in the first round, you must choose to which category you want to add points after final throw;

  - in the second round, you must choose to which category you want to add points after first throw;

  - in the third round, you roll to categories from top to bottom.

Additional rules:

    - in each round, if your overall school score is less than 0, 50 points are subtracted from your score. If you have over 15 points, 50 points are added. If you have between 0 and 15 points, then you just pass school with the value of sum you gathered;
    
    - if you roll a category in the first throw, you will receive double amount of points. This applies to categories under Two Pairs in the table;
    
    - if you roll a Yahtzee, you get maximum amount of possible points, no matter what figure you were rolling. E.g. if you roll a Yahtzee with Twos, you can assign the points to Two Pairs, which is 24 points (6, 6, 6, 6);
    
    
The music player works when you copy your mp3 music files to the folder where application is executed. Enjoy!
